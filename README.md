# Repo Import

This is a [ROBLOX](https://roblox.com) plugin that aids in letting you code your game outside of ROBLOX Studio.

Managing code with Git is very important, but currently not possible in ROBLOX. That's where this plugin and [Elixir](https://github.com/voxeldavid/elixir) come in.

Elixir compiles Lua source code into a ROBLOX Model file that you can import into your game. This lets you write all the code for your game outside of ROBLOX Studio, and then drag-and-drop the model in when you're ready.

With this approach you run into the workflow of: code -> compile -> drag into studio -> put everything in the right place. This plugin takes care of that last step for you.
